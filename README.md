# VueJS_First_Adventure

My first venture in to using Vue.js.  Building a small book searching site, that will pull its data from a book API.  That functionality is not yet available.

Still to restructure the files, in to single components.

Also utilising Vue.js Bootstrap for the styling, and a free logo maker for the images. 

There is a long way to go until this is a functioning site.
